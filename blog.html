            <p>Peter Jang, goes into great detail to paint the picture of how front-end development has changed over the
                years, particularly when it comes to JavaScript and it&apos;s evolution over the last 10-15 years. It is
                no wonder that there is such a demand for JavaScript programmers. It used to be a simple task to create
                a .js file and add some action to your webpages. NOW, however, everyone uses node management packages
                (npm), modular bundlers, transpilers, and task runners to create the cutting edge websites we see today.
                The author readily admits, “Web development used to be a great entry point for people new to programming
                precisely because it was so easy to get up and running; nowadays it can be quite daunting, especially
                because the various tools tend to change rapidly.”</p>
            <p>As I read this article, and try my best to not be overwhelmed by all there is to do with web development,
                I can&apos;t help but think that most of what Mr. Jang is describing is simple the evolutionary process.
                As things become more powerful, in many cases, they also become increasing complex; however, this does
                not mean that everything stays relevant. As is the way of growth, old and less visible parts for the
                process take less of a focus, and all though they are still there, many can get buy with focusing on the
                newest and most visible parts of the process. Sure, If I want to develop my own node packaging software,
                or innovate something new altogether, I would need to have a good understanding of all the moving parts,
                but as a beginner, first entering the world of web development, I find the complete history of
                JavaScript and front-end development an enhancement to my future day-to-day duties, but not a subject
                for regular application.</p>

            <p>Elliot, a student at the University of Energy and Natural Resources, highlights four things that he
                thinks will get job seeking web developers an edge of the competition. The first item on his list is
                creating a landing page. Although landing pages can be underrated, every company needs one, so it&apos;s
                a bit of a no brainer to add to a web development portfolio. The second item is to redesign a popular
                website. He doesn&apos;t go into much detail why, but claims it will help people to stand out. Third is
                to build an ecommerce site, and his main reasoning here, is that many job opportunities are opening up
                in ecommerce, and you may find yourself applying for a job in that area down the road. The fourth and
                last item is developing a log in system, since almost every website is has some focus on security. So,
                if we are to take Elliot&apos;s advise, we would have a pretty well mapped out plan for constructing a
                portfolio to set you apart from the rest.</p>
            <p>All and all, I think his points are fairly good; however, I don&apos;t think these items on their own
                will make a web developer stand out. I do think that including these four projects in a portfolio will
                give anyone ample opportunity to showcase what can be achieved with their current understanding of HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript. I think with any pitch to a hiring manager, you need to be able to tell a succinct
                story that is also relatable. By focusing projects around sites for companies that share a similar
                business model to possible future employers is just a good idea in general!</p>

            <h2 class="articleTitle">Why is WordPress Good?</h2>
            <figure class="thumbnail" aria-label="thumbnail">
                <a href="https://digitalagencynetwork.com/why-is-wordpress-good/" target="_blank">

                <figcaption>Why is WordPress&hellip;?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Well, to sum up this article… “WordPress is good,” according to author Joshua George. It&apos;s free (but
                of course you still need to pay for hosting and a domain name)! Moving on, the author states that Google
                searches tend to prefer websites built on WordPress vs others, designing your website is easy with
                various themes to choose from, it is a trusted platform that has been around for years with a reliable
                system (you know that server you need to pay for in order to have your website hosted?), and support is
                available (but only in the form of documentation and help forums if you are using the service for free).
                And, that&apos;s about all there is to it, you should just go get WordPress and start building your site
                today!</p>
            <p>Ahem…. Needless to say there is a lot missing from this article in terms of sources for examples and
                specific information about WordPress&apos; offerings. Mr. George claims that Google searches prefer
                WordPress created sites, but gives us know insights as to why. Are these older sites that have a lot of
                experience and credibility that just so happen to run on WordPress? Since about 40% of all websites run
                on WordPress, it could just be a sheer numbers game as to why many of their sites show up as top
                results. It really just depends on how you slice the data.</p>
            <p>Besides the lack of solid information, the article is overall misleading. I find this to be a disservice
                to WordPress and the future disappointed customers who choose to pursue them based on this article.
                There are many things to consider when starting a website, and NO, it is not free to launch your own
                website. WordPress is an incredible tool that has helped many people, but please do your research and
                visit the website to see what they truly have to offer. Or you know… read an article that can give you
                some solid stats on why you should choose this platform over another one.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>In this article, the &quot;Webflow Team&quot; describes the at a very high level, what UX strategy is and
                why it&apos;s important. First, the definition and role of UX is explained, then why. After a quick
                recap of those basics, the article digs a touch deeper by reviewing the 4 main principles of UX strategy
                and finishes up with next steps and some links for further reading on how to create your own UX
                strategy.</p>
            <p>I don&apos;t love that the article is so high level, given the title includes the phrase, <q>The ultimate
                    guide,</q> but I do appreciate the thoughtful structure and the breakdown of the trendy acronym.
                It&apos;s nice to read articles like this and be able to sum up what a hot topic is in a few bullet
                points. Now that my interest is peeked, I may be buying the book they recommended as well, for a deeper
                understanding of the topic.</p>
