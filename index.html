            <p>During his studies&comma; he has emphasized the use of JavaScript in every endeavor&period; Even when
                submitting his logic and design project&comma; he decided to debug and run a web based tic tac toe game

            <h2><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Experience</h2>
            <p>CSS has been this developer&apos;s most recent area of focus. He is fascinated by adding animation to a
                page using CSS, as well as changing the overall appearance of a page just by changing out a style sheet.
                Robby sees a lot of potential in CSS when updating websites based on seasonality. <q>It&apos;s a great
                    way to freshen things up!</q> one of his clients reports.</p>

            <p>React is a new area for Robby that he will be exploring as the Spring 2023 semester progresses. He hears
                great things and can&apos;t wait to see what he can do with it, but <em>FIRST</em>, he wants to have a
                strong understanding of the three pillars of web design: <abbr
                    title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and
